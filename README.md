# Embedded Machine Vision and Intelligent Automation
## ECEN 5763, CU Boulder, Summer 2021

### Introduction
This repository contains the work of Jake Michael for the ECEN 5763, Embedded Machine Vision and Intelligent Automation (EMVIA) course at CU Boulder in the summer of 2021. I will cite any additional sources or resources that I used to create this code and indicate those in code comments, READMEs, or other documentation. Please note that this code shall not be used by other CU Boulder students without the express written consent of both the instructor and myself along with proper citation of this code, as bounded by the MIT license agreement. 

### Dependencies
This code was developed for the Jetson Nano development kit. It utilizes:
- Jetpack 4.2.1
- OpenCV 3.3.1 (and it's dependencies)
- A UVC compliant webcam
- GNU toolchain (g++, make, etc.)

For Jetson setup, see [Getting Started with Jetson Nano](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit#intro).
